Read Me: Using Random Forest ML Algorithm and Data Cleaning on House Prices Prediction from Kaggle

Introduction:
This project aims to use the Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset used for this project is the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle which contains 79 features describing the different aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This project will also focus on data cleaning techniques to ensure that the model can make accurate predictions.

Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Data Cleaning:
Before building the model, it is important to clean the data and ensure that it is in a format that can be used by the model. This process involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Some of the data cleaning techniques that can be applied are:

Imputing missing values: Missing values can be imputed using techniques like mean, median or mode imputation.
Encoding categorical variables: Categorical variables can be encoded using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
Scaling numerical features: Numerical features can be scaled using techniques like Standard Scaling or Min-Max Scaling.
Building the Model:
After the data cleaning process is complete, the Random Forest model can be built. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble method that works by building multiple decision trees and combining their results to make a final prediction. To build the model, the following steps can be followed:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets: The dataset can be split into two sets - a training set to build the model and a testing set to evaluate its performance.
Defining the model: The Random Forest model can be defined by specifying the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and other hyperparameters.
Training the model: The model can be trained on the training data using the fit() function.
Evaluating the model: The model can be evaluated on the testing data using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2) score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Conclusion:
In this project, we have seen how the Random Forest algorithm can be used to predict house prices based on various features from the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle. We have also discussed some data cleaning techniques that can be applied to ensure that the model can make accurate predictions. By following these steps, we can build a robust and accurate model for predicting house prices.
